Of the three cases, given, A, B, and C, they are all best suited in the following cases:

A is best suited when there are a very small number of cases - perhaps only one or two.  In this case, it will use no memory whatsoever, and there are less registers needed and less constant overhead.  For example:
    case x of
        1: ...
        2: ...
    end

B is best used when there are a large number of sparse cases - e.g.
    case x of
        1: ...
        2: ...
        1000: ...
        2000: ...
        3000: ...
    end
Because, in this case, it will take O(log_2 n) time, which is more than case C, but will only take memory proportional to the number of cases, whereas case C would need many "empty" spaces in the jump table.

C is best when there are a large number of cases that are dense, as there will be minimal wasted space, and the time complexity will be O(1).  E.g.
    case x of
        1: ...
        2: ...
        3: ...
        (and so on, lots of cases right after each other)
    end
In this case, the amount of space used is actually less than case B, and the time complexity is lower.
